It has become very common amongst newer practitioners to relate to it as a random blur or haze that occurs due to either the subject or camera movement. On the contrary, only the roots of the term Bokeh is a Japanese word that refers to blur or haze, whereas in digital photography Bokeh technically signifies the aesthetic quality of the image’s out of focus areas! It is highly subjective and qualitative, as opposed to other digital photography aspects such as shutter speed or lens aperture, which typically have a quantitative system of measurement. It is the quality of the blur that is of significance, as there is no right or wrong when it comes to Bokeh; and there is no one particular perfect Bokeh lens. If you are looking to capture some images with beautiful soft Bokeh, it is essential to understand how the lens renders to creating that blur. The aesthetic quality of the blur can be controlled by following these simple techniques in order to get better Bokeh effects!

Subscribe Begin With Camera Settings In order to get a good quality Bokeh shot, it is essential to adjust some basic settings on the camera. Many professionals recommend opting for a large aperture and short focal distance. Choosing a large aperture enables to let in abundance of light into the image. It is advisable to turn on the Aperture Priority mode and choose the lowest f-number (f/1.8 up to even f/6) depending on the capabilities of your camera. This will help to narrow the focus on the subject as it dramatically reduces the depth of field and blurs everything surrounding the narrow focal point. Simply put, choosing a wide aperture means faster lens speed, which in turn translates to abundance of light flow and decreased depth of field. All this ultimately increases the chances of the image exhibiting a smooth out of focus areas!  Move Closer For Better Depth Of Field Since Bokeh refers to the blurry portion in a picture, it has a direct relationship with the depth of field. Depth of field is an indication of how much portion of the image is out of focus and hence, the direct correlation. A narrow depth of field will result in a larger blur; and in order to achieve this, it is advisable to ensure that there is sufficient distance between yourself and the light source in order to let in abundance of light. It is also important to get the lens as close to the subject as possible, without losing focus on the subject in order to achieve larger Bokeh areas. The closer you get to the subject, the higher the blur will be. The chances of getting close to the subject and still being able to focus are maximized by the use of a macro lens!  Foreground &amp; Background Silhouettes Once the technicalities such as aperture and depth of field have been taken care of, you can start concentrating on the creative aspects of the image. Instead of just creating random blurs in the background, you can try to relate the focal subject in the foreground to some aspect of the blurry background to create an unanticipated and interesting shot! It could be just the contrasting colors of the blur or the hue of lights or even a person. The pictures look more intriguing and captivating when there is an interaction between the foreground and background subject!  Bokeh is a very interesting technique that can significantly improve the aesthetic appeal of the image. However, it should not be wrongly used to mask poor photography or any uninspired creation!         ', 1, '-tips-038-techniques-for-better-bokeh-photography-', '2016-04-19', 1),

Required skills:  plugin development WordPress theme knowledge &hellip;                                      ', '            In this article I am going to explain in detail how can you revolutionize and improve your blog with one of the JavaScript libraries particularly jQuery. Required skills:  plugin development WordPress theme knowledge    About Bundled JavaScript libraries The prim purpose of JavaScript libraries is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your blog. Any Javascript library collects a lot of popular tasks that require heavy JavaScript coding to be achieved, and envelops them into methods so that you can run with a brief code. JavaScript libraries are ready, lightweight, and &#8220;write less, do more&#8221; codes. Numerous JavaScript libraries are built in WordPress. And jQuery is one of most extendable and the most popular JavaScript libraries. You can bring any JavaScript library for use in a specific page by using the wp_enqueue_script function. Examples of bundled JavaScript libraries:  Jquery: It is the prime library of JQuery. Go to the wp_enqueue_script function and apply “jquery”. jQuery UI Accordion: Go to  the wp_enqueue_script function and apply “jquery-ui-accordion” for  running an accordion style menus on your site. SWFObject:  Go to the wp_enqueue_script function and apply “swfobject” for embedding flash objects. Jcrop:  Go to the wp_enqueue_script function and apply “Image cropper” for cropping images. Tiny MCE: Go to the qp_enqueue_script function and apply “tiny_mce” for adding a WYSIWYG editor.  How To Run And Deploy The Created Wp_Enqueue_Script Functions? Before the call of the wp_head() function, the required function (javascript library) should be called first.  And to deploy any function you have applied to the Wp_Enqueue_Script Function so that you can run the addressed library, you have to call the function; and there is a general outline of calling a function and it is as follows. wp_enqueue_script(\r\n $handle\r\n ,$src\r\n ,$deps\r\n ,$ver\r\n ,$in_footer\r\n ); Here I will clarify each parameter that may be used, go on.  $handle : this demonstrate  the name of the script, use  lower case string $scr : If you are building  a plugin or get_template_directory_uri() and you want to inform WordPress where to find something, you should not insert the URL directly, so you need to use the plugins_url()  along with this parameter ($scr ) $deps:  if there is a script that cannot be found by WordPress , this parameter is an optional array of handles for locating other scripts that the library script based on. $ver – : To optionally show the version,use this parameter (string). In_footer :  By default, the script will be inserted in the  header, if you would prefer to include it in the bottom, simply use this parameter; it  originally has a false Boolean value.  Reference a jQuery function by using shortcut $ The jQuery $ shortcut can be safely used to refer to a jQuery function as a substitute to “jquery” jQuery(function ($) {\r\n /* Safely use $ here instead of jquery */\r\n }); In the previous example, we have enveloped the jQuery code in a nifty function so that we can write the $ as an alternative to “jquery”. Creating A WordPress Page With Jquery Or JavaScript To add a Jquery or JavaScript library to a certain page, there is a very basic approach to simply achieve your target. Let`s explain how to create a customized WordPress by applying that approach so that avoid any conflict or an inconvenience with the original way the default pages or posts work. Download the header.php file and the single.php file from the current theme directory. Working on the Single.php file  Back up the single.php you have downloaded by opening it in a text editor and &#8220;save as&#8221; it with a different name, to go on, you can save it javascript.php  so that you can follow the next steps without any confusion. Now open the file and remove the get_header() function ( at the top of your new file) At the very top of the file, write the following code:\r\n &lt;?php\r\n /*\r\n Template Name: javascript\r\n */\r\n ?&gt;\r\n &lt;?php get_header(&#8216;js&#8217;); ?&gt;  Template name:  has to be the same to the filename you chose in the step 1 To the get_header function I have added ‘js’.  “js” is part of the file name in step 6, so pay attention to what is done there.   In the javascript.php file, add the following code before the loop that begins with “if (have_posts()…”,\r\n &lt;span style=&#8221;color:red;cursor:pointer&#8221;&gt;Fade in square&lt;/span&gt;\r\n &lt;div id=&#8221;one&#8221; style=&#8221;margin:3px;width:80px; display:none;height:80px;float:left;background:#f00;&#8221;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n &lt;script&gt;\r\n $(document.body).click(function () {\r\n $(&#8220;#one&#8221;).fadeIn(6000);\r\n });\r\n &lt;/script&gt;  Then save the file.\r\n Working on the header.php file As usual, we need to back up the header.php file. Open the file and &#8220;Save as&#8221; it with the name “header-js.php”. Add header-js.php right before the call to the wp_head function:\r\n &lt;script src=&#8221;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  Save the file\r\n Uploading The New Template Files  Use your FTP software to upload the header-js.php file( the new header file) to your current theme directory. Now it is time up to create a new page and give it a title with the traditional way from your dashboard. To start running the jquery, in the right column and from the template dropdown menu select the template name you created. Update the page so that you save the changes; do not insert anything in the WYSIWYG editor. View the page by pressing the red link that says: “fade in square”. Now you should be seeing a red square that slowly fades in. If yes, then you are done and you created a custom page by using a JavaScript library. Here it is mine.

Images of animals created a game component, as well as help to distinguish product line.    Source Pablo &#038; Rusty’s Pablo &#038; Rusty’s approached Manual to rebrand the company and better reflect the values they’d developed over the past decade. An immersion into the brand began with a brief research trip to Sydney to learn more about local coffee culture and experience Pablo &#038; Rusty’s retail locations.     Source Khaohom: Sustainable Rice Packaging Using the traditional practices in Thailand, I searched on some facts and that some bamboos are actually used to cook certain food back in the days. I applied that idea to create a sticky rice packaging that can be reused to cook and store straight in the rice cooker.    Source Mammoth Beer Raging Mammoth’s inaugural product, the Tusk, provided a simple and clean way to “shotgun” beer.

The range includes: Shampoo, Conditioner, Foam, Hair Spray and Hair Oil. All containers are reusable. User can use the same package for unlimited times. The Design is following some of the Sustainable design guidelines such as: minimum usage of materials, no extra lids, all are made from recycled plastic (PLA-blend bio-flex). Simple design and shape, when containers get stack for transporting they take minimum space as they don&#8217;t leave empty spaces between &#8211; maximum number of product stacked (energy efficiency). Minimum usage of ink and printing with low-VOC inks. Nordic, clean and sophisticated design.    Source Exotic Coffee Collection by Paradise Each type of coffee from this collection is produced only in certain areas and has distinct unique taste. Mystical characters of Tiki (Hawaii), Barong (Indonesia), La Tolita Culture (Ecuador), Taino (Jamaica), Mahakala (Nepal), Furisiya (Yemen) inspired us to create vivid images, closely related to the distinctive cultures of the countries-suppliers of coffee.

Source VAP Package Jim Beam Honey    Source Warm Me Kid&#8217;s Yogurt The main idea is to get children interested in doing such boring thing as warming up yogurt before eating, and to turn this process into a game. Using the thermochromic ink I have created a special design for the yoghurt’s package. When the yogurt becomes warmer, the packing changes its color. When the product is in the fridge &#8211; packs are blue and animals are asleep. But when you warm it up – packs become white and the animals wake up. There is also a sign advising warming up the yogurt before eating.

The printing techniques and effects you choose influence the cost, look and time it takes to produce your printed items. Two printing types, letterpress and embossing, both add richness and dimension to your projects, but are very different in terms of process, price and the final printed appearance. Letterpress Letterpress is a centuries-old method of printing. While at one time almost all printing was done by letterpress, today the process is primarily limited to finer stationery, such as wedding invitations. The letterpress process involves inking a plate with an image — usually wood or metal, but in some cases, a heavy-duty polymer or plastic — and applying it to thick paper with a substantial amount of manual pressure. The result is a very precise debossed, or imprinted, image on the paper with rich color; each piece appears individually hand-stamped. When you run your hand over letterpress printing, you can feel the divots where the images are printed. Unlike other types of printing, the letterpress method allows you to experiment with fonts, paper and colors to create exactly the look and feel that you want for your project. Embossing Embossing is the opposite of letterpress. Also known as &#8220;blind embossing,&#8221; embossing uses a plate — typically either metal or plastic — and pressure to create a raised image on the front of the paper. Blind embossing does not use ink; instead, the image stands out from the page in raised relief, adding subtle dimension to the paper. This printing technique is common on invitations or fine stationery. For example, a monogram or edge design may be embossed on a wedding invitation or note card. An alternative embossing technique, heat embossing, adds both color and texture to a project. Heat embossing requires adding embossing powder to an inked image, such as from a rubber stamp, and then heating the powder until it melts and creates a raised surface. The technique is popular among scrapbookers and other paper crafters, who emboss images to add subtle texture to their projects. Crafters can also use a multipurpose tool with an embossing tip to add raised relief to paper. Cost When choosing between letterpressed or embossed stationery, cost is a primary consideration. Because letterpress requires higher quality paper and specialty ink to achieve the full effect, it can cost up to three times as much as other printing processes, such as thermography or digital printing. The increased cost is also due to the labor-intensive nature of letterpress; in most cases, each piece is printed individually. Embossing, on the other hand, does not add significant cost to a printing project. Commercial manufacturers can generally emboss multiple pieces at a time.

Sussing out your competitors, their income, their resources spent and finding out the consumer opinion on these packaging design is essential. Only once you have all of this information at the tips of your fingers, can you let yourself design to your hearts content. Spicemode by Isabela Rodrigues Spicemode is a s line of international specialty food products is focused on showcasing all-natural, handcrafted and healthy versions of the flavor-forward and vibrantly-spiced curries from India.        Proactiv Packaging by Kate Carmack A gender-neutral packaging redesign for Proactiv Solution, an acne treatment system. The new bottles were designed to appeal to teenagers-Proactiv’s target market—by utilizing the more sophisticated look of a beauty product in place of its current “medical” appearance. The minimalist design highlights Proactiv’s very simple 3-step process, and the geometric, interlocking numbers suggest that each step is akin to a puzzle piece; integral to the completion and efficacy of the system.     3 cows 2 cats by Olga Mosina The cocktail line includes 4 of the kid’s favourite flavours: banana, strawberry, vanilla and chocolate.\r\n Due to limited package space we decided to create a separate hero for every flavor and two heros for chocolate flavor (two cats)  – he appears on the face of the package.     Delices de Michele &#8211; Brand Identity &amp; Packagings by Chez Valois     Petit Natural Juice by Isabela Rodrigues These funny collectible juice packaging were developed with all our affection for children, “les petits”. With tetra pack packaging that retain more natural juices, all packages have been designed in a sustainable use, with papers and returnable bottles.       Pureza Aga by Antonio Luna   Froot Loops Packaging Design Concept by Diego     ZEST by Derrick Lin  Zest is a low calorie superfruit juice sweetened with Stevia that was developed to satisfy the most health-conscious consumers. It is made of all-natural ingredients and contains no preservatives, aromas or colorings. The beverage is packed with fruits that are high in antioxidants and that offer strong health benefits for a healthy and tasty refreshing experience.     COMON SAVA by Maxim Kadashov Beautiful package design concept of COMON SAVA. It comes from French greeting &#8220;Comment ca va&#8221; which sounds very similar to Russian word &#8220;sova&#8221; (owl) and altogether with &#8220;comon&#8221; it sounds like «come on sova&#8221; (which is literarily is come on owl!). These phonetic synonyms are perfect match because the main hero of this pack is owl by itself.     Cocoville – Handmade fine chocolates by Isabela Rodrigues The Isabela Rodrigues Sweety Branding Studio also loves chocolate and loves amazing brands.       Aurum by Isabela Rodrigues Aurum is a brand of natural cosmetics focused on organic products.     Eoliva Packaging Design by  In the packaging, the handmade tradition is translated in the utilization of noble materials, formal and conceptual related to its origin, to the tools and the processes where the product is born. The paper gives our product a natural language. It is accompanied by a manual sewing, where quality rules over complexity. It has been conceived since the beginning as green thinking product. That is the reason why the pack does not use any kind of adhesive and is produced exclusively of biodegradable materials.     MidNight Drinks by  Mucho MidNight drinks is proposing a unique idea for cocktail consumption. Using a simple system involving a backing box with cocktail mixes and a box shaker, their intention is to revolutionize the way people create cocktails both in bars and at home. The cocktail mixes maintain the essence of classic cocktails but this new method results in surprisingly excellent quality cocktails.   Yollibox Frozen Yogurt  by Erenstrahle &amp; Wagnert &#8220;Yollibox is introducing frozen yoghurt for the Swedish market. Made on only natural ingredients it&#8217; a healthy choice instead of the swedish ice cream and sorbet.&#8221; As an alternative choice from Ice Cream and Sorbet, Yollibox comes in a unique package, half way between a box and a traditional pint (if you ask me, it also resemblance a chinese &#8216;take out&#8217; box).       Burnt Sugar packaging by d.studio     Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf by Daneille Duran &#8220;Our concept was to be bright, refreshing and innovative. The biggest challenge was to visually communicate carbonated to non-carbonated, the fruit flavor and that it is, iced tea in a can. We wanted to stand out with a bold design, but still maintain a classic and clean look.     Beanies The Flavour Co by Robot Food Beanies The Flavour Co. has launched a range of flavour coffee exclusively for Sainsbury’s, with a new design created by specialist branding partner Robot Food. The creative team worked in close collaboration with Sainsbury’s to deliver exactly what it felt was missing from the shelves. Beanies’ commitment to satisfy the retailer was rewarded in volume orders, which are hitting the shelves by mid July.     Sweet Cream Suds by Maeve Rogers The concept was to capture an old-town general store feel using a mixture of delicate and playful fonts with subtle decorative elements. The one-color design not only allows an economical solution for a start-up business, but also emphasizes the company&#8217;s commitment to using pure ingredients in their products.&#8221;     Marc Jacobs Cosmetics  by Established Design studio Established was specially selected by Marc Jacobs and Sephora, the world&#8217;s best-known specialty beauty retailer, to partner on the design of Marc Jacobs Beauty. The highly anticipated makeup line will be sold exclusively in Sephora stores across North America and available on August 9th.         Femme Natural Boost by  Ehrenstrahle &amp; Wagnert Femininity and independence were the key words in the creation of Femme’s brand, which included a complete graphic profile and packaging design. In terms of branding we wanted to express attitude and self-confidence with the female at the heart of it, which sets Femme apart from other competitors in the energy drink market. By working with a saturated yet distinctive color along with hand-drawn typeface, the can got an expression that was feminine without being perceived as cliché-like.      Celebrity Matches by  Nick Yates Celebrity Matches is Pictionary with a greater risk of third degree burns. UK based designer, Nick Yates was inspired by a game his tutors and her friends would play whilst at a pub &#8211; simply from playing around with matches. As an excuse to play around with print techniques and packaging, he decided to make it a reality.         Beehive by Lacy Kuhn The Heartland line of breakfast cereals is a newly conceived experiment by the National Cereal Corporation. The marketing strategy is based on the celebration of breakfast cereal’s all-American roots. Each flavor will be named after a state’s nickname; the pilot being Beehive Honey Squares. The packaging seeks to stand out from the competition, a blatant contrast to the standard cereal box approach.   Mova Ice Cream by Luko Designs Mova Ice Cream is an English brand ice cream and is now being introduced to the American market. Based in the heart of England’s beautiful Camden District, the business is run and owned by husband and wife team Matthew and Isabel Mova.  Mova Ice Cream is full of the finest ingredients skillfully blended into an exciting feast of flavours that are purely indulgent.     Green Packaging by Kate Allaire     Nika Bottles by Stephen Bennett  Nika Water is social cause-driven, eco-responsible, premium bottled water, currently sold in thousands of nationwide retailers. This includes major natural food stores, in addition to cafes, coffee shops, delis, nightclubs, hotels, schools, fitness and beauty locations and more.     Razatusa Olive Oil by Sesnic &amp; Turkovic The Croatian olive-producing region of Razatuša gave this extra virgin olive oil its name. The logo consists of the majuscule “R”, composed of olives and leaves. The application of the label is kept simple, since the family business does the labelling on its own. Accordingly, the label was designed so that it can easily be slipped onto the bottle and then fixed by a wax stamp. The harvest year can be written on the label by hand, while its fabric also prevents drops of oil from dripping onto the table.

Isometric pixel art is created in a near-isometric diametric projection (i.e. about 30 degrees angle from horizontal), as seen in some old games where they provide a 3D view of scenes. Non-isometric pixel art refers to those that are not isometric, for example, views from top, side, front, bottom or perspective views.

Typically, a logo’s design is for immediate recognition. The logo is one aspect of a company’s commercial brand, or economic or academic entity, and its shapes, colors, fonts, and images usually are different from others in a similar market. Awesome and Creative Logos Designs are also used to identify organizations and other non-commercial entities.  What is Logo Template? The main difference between a regular logo and Logo Templates is that Logo Templates are developed to reflect the main idea of the industry not the particular company. To meet the company’s theme you will probably need to do some customization: change company name, colors, etc. AlMubdi offers two kinds of Logo Templates: Unique and Non-Unique. When a logo template is purchased at the Unique price, it is removed from our database so that you get an absolutely exclusive logo design at an affordable price. Non-Unique Logo Templates can’t be bought under the unique price, as they aren’t eligible for the unique category once they’ve been bought at the regular price. Inspiring Logo is the most important part of any brand as it is the only thing that is used as brand identity. Designing a unique and beautiful logo is not that easy task. A designer needs a lot of inspiration work to design a logo that stand out of the crowd. Today I am going to showcase 90 custom logo template designs for inspiration .
